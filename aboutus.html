<br>
<br>
I created VRACA to help people experience the wonders of the world while in lockdown. VRACA was started when most of the  world was quarantined and unable to travel, therefore, I wanted to create something that would give everyone the ability to explore different cities.
<br>
<br>
<span class = "Titleaboutus">How many Packages are there?</span>
<br>
<br>
Currently the website features 3 city packages from around the world! However, I hope to add another 8-10 city packages soon
